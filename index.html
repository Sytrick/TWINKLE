      <blockquote>
        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:80%" ><i>“Life, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself.”
― Madeleine L'Engle, A Wrinkle in Time</p>
        <footer style="font-family:garamond; font-size:150%"><b>Upon first discovering this quote, I was captivated by how true it this sentence is, especially for the characters in the story. A story like A Wrinkle in Time teaches one to become a better person, and to spread kindness towards others, but also to believe in yourself. So my first reaction to this story is one of total agreement. There isn't much reason for me to not feel the way I do about this quote since it talks about making your own story, which is ultimately what I think this story is about. A perfect quote for this novel. -  Victor<cite></footer>

        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:80%">"If you aren’t unhappy sometimes you don’t know how to be happy." ― Madelein L'Engle, A Wrinkle in Time</p>
        <footer style="font-family:garamond; font-size:150%">This is when Charles states that all suffering and unhappiness is eliminated on Camazotz, Meg replies, "Maybe if you aren't unhappy sometimes you don't know how to be happy." As they rise up many floors, Charles keeps mentioning IT, who he says is the boss and the one mind that thinks for all the individuals of Camazotz so that individuality no longer exists. I think that Meg’s words are right. Sometimes, you need to be sad to be happy. If you always smile at everyone then you’ll be considered a weird person. Maybe you are mentally ill. - John<cite></footer>

        <footer style="font-family:garamond; font-size:150%">This quote is told by Meg Murry in chapter six, I totally agree with this quote. There is no denying that anger can provide us with an invisible power to push us to become fearless. We have been taught that anger is not a good emotion since we started as a kid, from our parents, teachers even our peers say so. Everyone tells us to always be positive and teaches us how to control or suppress our anger, but no one tells us how to change our anger into a motivation to face the fear.  - Rey<cite></footer>
